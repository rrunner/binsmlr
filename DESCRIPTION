Description: The objective with the package is to perform a statistical optimal 
    binning of ordinal values taking the default rate of each bin in 
    consideration. The bins produced should be homogenous within and 
    heterogenous across bins in terms of the default risk. A binning approach, 
    as a data transformation, is generally feasible to credit risk portfolios 
    having a relatively large number of defaults. A prerequisite is that each 
    observation is assigned an ordinal value such as score or rating 
    etc., that indicates the relative default risk as proposed by the rank 
    ordering model. Also, a default indicator is required. 
    Binning is common in different credit risk applications.
